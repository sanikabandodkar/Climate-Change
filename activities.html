<h1>Human Activities</h1>
<h3>Human activities are the main cause of climate change, and include:</h3>
<ul>
<h3>
<li>Burning fossil fuels: Burning coal, oil, and gas for electricity and heat releases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere </li>
<li> Deforestation: Cutting down forests releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as trees absorb carbon dioxide to regulate the climate</li>
<li>Livestock farming: Cows and sheep produce methane when they digest food </li>
<li>Fertilizers: Nitrogen-containing fertilizers release nitrous oxide emissions </li>
<li>Fluorinated gases: Equipment and products that use these gases emit emissions that are 23,000 times more warming than carbon dioxide </li>
<li> Oil and gas development: Drilling, fracking, transporting, and refining oil and gas</li>
<li>Buildings: Heating, cooling, cooking, and running appliances 
 </li>
 </h3>
 </ul>
