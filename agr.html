<h1>Agricultural Emissions</h1>
<ul>
<h3>
<li>Agriculture contributes approximately 10 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (not including emissions from onsite fossil energy use).</li>
<li>Agricultural emissions of greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. To evaluate the total impacts, emissions of the latter two gases can be converted to "carbon dioxide equivalent” (CO2e) based on their relative impacts on climate change.</li>
<li>Agricultural emissions of greenhouse gases result from complex natural processes that are difficult to measure – in contrast with emissions from burning fossil fuels.</li>
<li>Methane comes primarily from livestock digestion (known as enteric fermentation) and the way livestock manure is managed. It contributes the most to agricultural emissions of greenhouse gases./li>
<li>The second largest contributor is nitrous oxide, which results mostly from agricultural fertilizer application to soils and from manure management.</li>
<li> Carbon dioxide emissions come from increased decomposition of plant matter in soils and from converting lands to agricultural uses. Those emissions are partially offset by the increased plant matter stored in cropland soils.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by planting additional crops outside of the primary growing season (known as cover cropping). Using cultivation methods that cause less disturbance to soil also can reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
