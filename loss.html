<h1>Economic loss</h1>
<h3>The economic losses caused by climate change have significant implications for human well-being and socio-economic development. Here's how they affect people:

</h3>
<ul>
<h3>
<li>Damage to Infrastructure: Climate-related events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and storms can damage or destroy critical infrastructure including homes, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and utilities. Rebuilding and repairing infrastructure impose substantial financial burdens on governments, businesses, and individuals, diverting resources away from other essential needs.

</li>
<li> Loss of Livelihoods: Climate change disrupts economic activities such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and manufacturing, leading to loss of livelihoods and income for millions of people. Crop failures, droughts, and extreme weather events affect farmers, fishermen, and small businesses, particularly in vulnerable regions with limited adaptive capacity.</li>
<li>Impact on Businesses: Climate-related risks such as supply chain disruptions, property damage, and increased insurance costs pose challenges for businesses across various sectors. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts due to limited resources and adaptive capacity, affecting employment, investment, and economic growth.</li>
<li>Decreased Productivity: Extreme heat, water scarcity, and weather variability reduce agricultural productivity, impairing food security and economic growth. Heat stress affects outdoor workers such as farmers, construction workers, and laborers, leading to decreased productivity, absenteeism, and health-related costs.</li>
<li>Increased Healthcare Costs: Climate-related health impacts such as heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, vector-borne diseases, and injuries result in increased healthcare expenditures for individuals, communities, and governments. Treating climate-related health conditions and responding to health emergencies impose financial burdens on healthcare systems and public health budgets. </li>
<li>Insurance Costs and Financial Risks: Climate-related disasters lead to increased insurance claims, higher premiums, and financial losses for insurers, reinsurers, and policyholders. The growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events pose systemic risks to the insurance industry and financial markets, affecting economic stability and investment decisions.</li>
<li>Displacement and Migration Costs: Climate-related displacement and migration result in social and economic costs, including loss of property, livelihoods, and social networks. Governments and communities bear the burden of providing humanitarian assistance, shelter, and support services for displaced populations, exacerbating social tensions and resource constraints.
