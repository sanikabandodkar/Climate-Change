<h1>Health Risk</h1>
<h3>Climate change poses significant health risks to human populations across the globe. Here's how:</h3>
<ul>
<h3>
<li>Heat-related Illnesses: Rising temperatures increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, leading to heat-related illnesses such as heatstroke, heat exhaustion, and dehydration. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions, are particularly at risk. </li>
<li>Respiratory Problems: Climate change exacerbates air pollution and triggers respiratory problems such as asthma, allergies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Higher temperatures and increased pollen levels contribute to longer and more severe allergy seasons.

</li>
<li>Vector-borne Diseases: Climate change affects the distribution and behavior of disease-carrying vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. This leads to the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus, posing significant public health challenges.</li>
<li>Waterborne Diseases: Extreme weather events such as floods and heavy rainfall can contaminate water sources, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and gastrointestinal infections. Poor sanitation and inadequate access to clean water exacerbate the risk of disease transmission.</li>
<li>Food Insecurity and Malnutrition: Climate change affects food production, availability, and nutritional quality, leading to food shortages, price volatility, and malnutrition. Crop failures, droughts, and extreme weather events disrupt agricultural systems, exacerbating food insecurity and undernutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations.

</li>
<li>Mental Health Impacts: Climate change contributes to mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extreme weather events, displacement, loss of livelihoods, and environmental degradation can lead to psychological distress and exacerbate pre-existing mental health conditions.

</li>
<li>Injuries and Deaths: Climate-related disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and storms result in injuries, fatalities, and long-term health impacts. The physical and psychological toll of disasters extends beyond the immediate aftermath, affecting individuals, families, and communities for years to come.
