<h1>Extreme Weather</h1>
<h3>
Extreme weather events resulting from climate change can have significant and wide-ranging impacts on human health, well-being, and livelihoods. Here are some of the ways in which extreme weather can affect humans:</h3>
<ul>
<h3>
<li>Direct Health Impacts: Extreme heatwaves can lead to heat-related illnesses such as heatstroke, dehydration, and heat exhaustion, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Extreme cold events can also increase the risk of hypothermia and frostbite.

</li>
<li>Increased Mortality and Morbidity: Extreme weather events, including heatwaves, storms, floods, and wildfires, can result in injuries, displacement, and loss of life. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected by these events.</li>
<li>Vector-Borne Diseases: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect the distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, and Lyme disease. Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns can expand the geographic range of disease vectors and increase the frequency and intensity of outbreaks.

</li>
<li>Waterborne Diseases: Flooding and heavy rainfall events can contaminate drinking water sources, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and gastrointestinal infections. Poor sanitation and infrastructure exacerbate the risk of disease transmission during extreme weather events.

 </li>
<li>Food Insecurity: Extreme weather events, including droughts, floods, and storms, can disrupt agricultural production, leading to crop failures, food shortages, and increased food prices. This can exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in low-income and food-insecure communities.</li>
<li>Mental Health Impacts: Extreme weather events can have profound psychological effects, including anxiety, stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Displacement, loss of livelihoods, and exposure to traumatic events can contribute to mental health disorders and emotional distress.</li>
<li>Displacement and Migration: Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, floods, and other extreme weather events can force communities to relocate, leading to displacement and migration. Climate-induced displacement can exacerbate social tensions, increase competition for resources, and strain infrastructure and social support systems.
